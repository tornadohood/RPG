Pokemon Battle System Version 1.0

Pokemon Battle System is a  based demo of the video game [Pok√©mon Red/Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue) running in python 3.

I am trying ti mimic the entire game using python. The library allows for easy implementation and customization of tile based maps like the ones contained in this demo.
